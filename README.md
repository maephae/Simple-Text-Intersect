# Simple Data Intersect
 A quick text construct of a set intersection.

 Use cases:
 - Take a text file/large string input and exclude or include specific parts
 - Input a string and highlight when and where it occurred.
 - Check for given words or strings and return all instances as well as the line it's on

 brainstorm:
 return set window
 exclude set window return result
 exclude recurring 
 return data from recurring i space with n length window
 scan for string and return the place it appears in text
 two kinds of returns, string with space sep or array
